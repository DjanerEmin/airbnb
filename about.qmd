🪴 **Feel at Home**

This is my home. Be my guest in my tiny flat decorated by me **personal touches**. I’ve designed it to be a calming place to unwind, recharge, or just enjoy a calm moment.

You’ll find some of my **yoga and pilates equipment**, which you are very welcome to use during your stay. If you’re looking for a guided session you can use **the Apple TV** to find insprational videos. For a cozy night in, feel free to explore the **streaming platforms** available.

📶 Wi-Fi is fast and free throughout the apartment.

🌯 **Food & convenience**:

A **mini-bar area** with a **fridge**, **coffee machine**, **water kettle**, and **basic utensils and cups** is available to enjoy a quiet morning coffee or a small snack.

🍴 The flat doesn’t have a kitchen, you’ll find everything you need for a simple breakfast or evening drink.

There’s a small **Imbiss** offering takeaway meals, and a **Spätshop** around the corner is open evenings till 1 am. There you can grab snacks, drinks, or anything you might have forgotten. It’s perfect for late arrivals or quick bites without going far.

Further recommendations for nearby shops, restaurants, bakeries, cafés you will find in the flat.
