🌯 **Food & convenience**:

A **mini-bar area** with a **fridge**, **coffee machine**, **water kettle**, and **basic utensils and cups** is available to enjoy a quiet morning coffee or a small snack.

🍴 The flat doesn’t have a kitchen, you’ll find everything you need for a simple breakfast or evening drink.

There’s a small **Imbiss** offering takeaway meals, and a **Spätshop** around the corner is open evenings till 1 am. There you can grab snacks, drinks, or anything you might have forgotten. It’s perfect for late arrivals or quick bites without going far.
